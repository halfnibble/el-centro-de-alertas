  El Centro de la Razaâ€™s historic building in Seattle and our Federal Way office building will be closed to the public March 17th until further notice, but staff are working remotely to continue to provide many of our 43 programs and services, checking in with program participants about their needs, and to enroll people in emergency benefits. These are very tough decisions for our community and we appreciate your patience and support. Please visit http://www.elcentrodelaraza.org/covid-19/ for more information about our programs and services during this time.
